PCB and mount project for Arcooda Arcade monitor

I found the original PCB coming with the monitor to be too big and not super practical when combined with djcall's feet design. So I designed a mini PCB and mount to fit in the gap using the same mounting holes.

To assemble the PCB you need to source:
- 1x 2 color LED (ex: )
- 1x [JST 8pin connector B8B-PH-K-S(LF)(SN)] (https://www.digikey.ca/en/products/detail/jst-sales-america-inc./B8B-PH-K-S(LF)(SN)/926617)
- 5x [TS342A2P Tactile Switches](https://jlcpcb.com/partdetail/SHOUHAN-TS342A2P/C398055)

To assemble the mount you need to source:
- 2x M2*4 self tapping screws

To fix the mount in place you'll need to upgrade your M5 screws to at least 25mm. You'll need 2 with matching extra nuts.

If you just want a mount for the original PCB, you can grab my design on Printable right [here](https://www.printables.com/model/341039-arcooda-pcb-side-panel-support).
